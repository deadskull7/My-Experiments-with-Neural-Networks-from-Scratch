# My-Experiments-with-Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

#### In the above, I have dealt with a simple neural network in order to work closely with the neural network basics which mainly includes gradient descent , feed forward algorithm , back-propagation algorithm. Doing things at the fundamental level to have better understanding of neural networks.

#### My work also includes varying the hyperparameters such as epochs , learning rates and neurons in dense layer or hidden layer and studied their effects on cost function and speed of convergence . Changes in error with learning rates and epochs for different number of neurons in hidden layers was also studied.
